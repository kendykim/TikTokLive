TikTok LIVE API for Python
==========================

TikTokLive is the unofficial TikTok LIVE API for Python: real-time comments,
gifts, likes, follows and viewer counts from any public TikTok livestream.

It also emits shares, battles and 50+ other event types. Connecting requires
only a creator's @unique_id -- no login, credentials, or app registration.
These docs cover the full public API surface. If you are new, start with the
quickstart in the project overview below, then move to the module reference.

What is in these docs
---------------------

- :doc:`TikTokLive` — the top-level package: client, events, protobuf schema
- :doc:`TikTokLive.client` — ``TikTokLiveClient``, connection lifecycle, configuration
- :doc:`TikTokLive.client.web` — the HTTP client and its route methods
- :doc:`TikTokLive.client.ws` — the Webcast WebSocket layer
- :doc:`TikTokLive.events` — every event type you can subscribe to
- :doc:`TikTokLive.proto` — generated protobuf message definitions

A note on production use
------------------------

TikTokLive is a reverse-engineering project, not a supported vendor API.
TikTok can and does change the Webcast protocol without notice. For workloads
that need an uptime guarantee, the managed
`TikTok LIVE WebSocket API <https://www.eulerstream.com/websockets>`_ from
`Euler Stream <https://www.eulerstream.com/>`_ handles signing, scaling and
protocol drift for you.
